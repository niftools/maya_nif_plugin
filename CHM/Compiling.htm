<h2>Compiling from Source</h2>

<p>If you have Maya for Windows version 6.5, 7.0, 8.0, or 8.5, the above is all
you need to worry about since you can use the pre-compiled version. But if you
have a different version, or you want to use the latest unreleased code from
SVN, you're going to have to compile the MLL plug-in file from the source code.
</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>On your C: drive, add a folder called NifTools. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Inside the NifTools folder, create two subfolders called
     niflib and maya. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Right click on the maya folder and use it to check out the
     maya code from SVN. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Right click on the niflib folder and use it to check out
     the niflib code from SVN. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Compiling the code</h3>

<p>To to compile the most current code, you will need to check out both Niflib
and the Maya plug-in source code from SVN, as described above. You should then
first compile Niflib as a dynamic library. On Windows, using MSVC, you can open
the Niflib solution and choose the <b>Release - DLL</b> configuration from the
drop-down on the tool bar, and then select <b>Build &gt; Build Solution</b>
from the menu. This will create the <b>niflib.dll</b> file in the <b>bin</b>
folder within the folder where you downloaded the Niflib code. </p>

<p>If you haven't already, you should also add the location of the include and
lib folders within this same folder to your compiler's search paths so that
your other projects which use Niflib will be able to include the code. This is
done in MSVC by selecting <b>Tools &gt; Options...</b> from the menu, and then
expanding &quot;Projects and Solutions&quot; and selecting &quot;VC++
Directories&quot; in the left pane. Then in the right pane, you should select <b>Include
Files</b> from the <b>Show directories for</b> drop down box, and then add the
location of the Niflib <b>include</b> folder. Next, do the same thing for <b>Library
Files</b> and add the Niflib <b>lib</b> folder. </p>

<p>Finally, you will compile the Maya Plug-in code. This process requires that
your compiler be aware of the location of both Niflib and the Maya SDK include
and lib files. On Windows, using MSVC, you can open the Maya Plug-in solution
and select the version of Maya you have from the configuration drop down. If
your version is not listed or if you installed Maya in a non-standard location,
however, you will need to add the correct paths similar to the way the Niflib
paths were added above. Alternatively, if you know what you're doing, you can
create a new configuration with the proper path or edit an existing
configuration to correct the path. Once you have the path configured correctly,
you can select <b>Build &gt; Build Solution</b> and the result will be the <b>nifTranslator.mll</b>
file created in the <b>bin</b> folder within the folder where the Plug-in code
was downloaded. It should be located in a sub-folder that indicates the version
of Maya that selected in the configuration drop-down when the solution was
built. </p>

<p>If you have any problems at this phase, such as code errors involving
functions not being found or having the wrong number of parameters, Niflib may been
changed in ways that break the Maya plug-in. The version of Niflib that was
current when the plug-in worked on last was 0.7.2, so using that version may
fix the problems. </p>

<p>Once you have everything compiled, you will have to move the resulting files
to their proper locations. On Windows, the <b>niflib.dll</b> file can be moved
to the Maya folder, while the <b>nifTranslator.mll</b> file can be moved to the
<b>plug-ins</b> folder within the Maya folder. The nifTranslatorOpts.mel
options script should also be placed in a location where Maya can find it, such
as the <b>scripts/others</b> folder within the Maya folder. You should now be
able to activate the plug-in from within Maya as described at the beginning of
this page. </p>

<p>This code <i>should</i> be compatible with multiple versions of Maya on
multiple operating systems, but only the above-mentioned versions for Windows
have been tested. If you successfully compile this code for another version of
Maya, please post a link to your build on the <a
href="http://niftools.sourceforge.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=12"
title="http://niftools.sourceforge.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=12">niftools forum</a>
so others can use it! </p>

<h2>Want to Help?</h2>

<p>If you can program in C++, have Maya, and want to help make this plug-in
better, we can always use more people working on the project. Just let us know
you're interested on the NifTools <a
