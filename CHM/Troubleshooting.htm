<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If you have put the script in some other location before, it may take
precedence over your new copy. If you are having trouble getting a new version
to work, you can get a list of all the paths that Maya is looking for scripts
by entering this command in Maya's command line: </p>

<p><b>getenv &quot;MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH&quot;;</b> </p>

<p>Check each one to make sure there is not another copy of <b>nifTranslatorOpts.mel</b>
somewhere preventing your new one from working. Delete any extra copies you
find. </p>

<p>Just as an example of how many places Maya might look for scripts, my output
from this command shows the following locations: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>I am having issues with the exporting

<span class=postbody>When I export the nif file, it exports just fine, well at

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Answer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody>Since all named &quot;PolyShape&quot;
with sequential numbers, I can only assume that they are all actual transform
nodes that exist in your Maya scene. There is nothing in the exporter that
would give things sequential numbers like that, and that naming convention is
the standard Maya one for default names of Polygon Shapes, so it must be coming
from Maya itself. In general, the exporter will create a NIF file that looks
almost exactly like what you see in the HyperGraph, so that's the first place
to start looking for extra things like that. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>One possibility is that at some point while working on
your scene in Maya, you deleted the actual polygon shape node, but did not
delete the transform node above it, which determines its placement in the
scene. This would cause the exporter to create a NiNode for that transform,
instead of a NiTriShape or NiTriStrips for the transform/shape node pair. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>I would suggest looking at the HyperGraph of your scene to
try to find out what the extra nodes with &quot;PolyShape&quot; in their name
that you do not want are doing there. The easiest way is to type, &quot;select
&lt;name&gt;;&quot; in the command line text box at the bottom of the screen
and press enter. Then open the Hypergraph in &quot;Input and Output
Connections&quot; mode and you should see the selected node in Yellow, along
with all nodes that are connected to inputs or outputs of that node. I would do
this for each of the names of the NiNodes that you show in your sceen shot, if it
is not obvious what is going on from the first one. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>In addition, the exporter tries to ignore history items,
but sometimes Maya does not mark them as history or other problems caused by
their presence, so you should always delete non-deformer history before running
a Maya exporter. </span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody>Also, realize that hidden objects are exported just like
non-hidden ones, they are just simply marked &quot;hidden&quot; in the NIF
file. This allows you to more seamlessly import and re-export NIF files that
have hidden but necessary elements, such as the shadows in Morrowind NIF files.
