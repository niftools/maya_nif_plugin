=Version 0.1=

* Initial Release

=Version 0.2=

* Updated to Niflib 0.4.  Now most Nif files from version 4.0.0.0 to 10.2.0.0
  can be imported.
* Added support for importing vertex colors.
* Scene Root no longer translated to a Maya transform node on import.

=Version 0.3=

* Expanded NIF support including Oblivion and Civ4
* Filter now works correctly in open dialog box (only NIF files are shown when
  NetImmerse Format is selected)
* Errors and warnings show in Maya's main window instead of the Output Window.

=Version 0.3.1=

* Sped up loading of skinned meshes significantly.  These now load almost as
  fast as NIF files without skins.
* Included Pre-release Niflib code in source archive to make it easier for
  people to compile the plug-in themselves.
  
=Version 0.4=

* Added experimental export support.

=Version 0.5=

* Realized that one of the functions I called is not supported by Maya 6.5.
  Removed vertex color export from that version for now.
* Organized options into Common, Import, and Export groups.
* Added new options:  Attempt to Find Original Bind Pose, Try to Use Original
  Normals, Ignore Ambient Color, and Export White Ambient if Texture is
  Present.
* Fixed problem with import of glow textures.  Texture index was off by one
  due to being incremented at the wrong time.
* Skin clusters should now always be properly detected no matter how distantly
  they're connected to the mesh they deform.
* A NiAlphaProperty is now created on export if the base texture has any
  transparency specified in its alpha channel.
* Glow textures are now supported for export.
* Removed warning for transparency texture.  This was caused by the alpha
  channel of the base map being connected to transparency as it should be.
* Changed all cout statements to use the out file stream so they would not
  write to the Maya Output window.
* Only NiNodes that are skin influences are now imported as IKJoints.
  Previously nodes with the word "Bip" in the name were also made into joints
  but this was incorrect.
* Now import ambient as well.  It looks bad in renders, but not importing it
  results in exports that do not match the original file.
* Vertex colors are now exported.
* Maya's default objects (such as the top, front, side, and persp camera) are
  no longer exported.
* Exported the name of the FileTexture node in the resulting NiSourceTexture
  object.
* Paths of textures are now fixed by removing any part of the beginning that
  matches the texture path specified in the options.
* Texture path can now optionally end with an extra \ character after the last
  directory name.
* Fixed a bug where two \ characters were always added to whatever texture
  path the user specified.
* Added skin export support. For now, just exports the mesh in its present
  position.  Disabled old behavior of searching for the bind position of the
  mesh.
* Fixed detection of history items to be more accurate.
* Names of split meshes now set properly.
* Moved all vertex cloning/triangulation code into Niflib and can now support
  multiple materials and UV sets per mesh.
* Properly handle glossiness/cosine power for Phong shaders.  Blinn now
  defaults to a glossiness of 20.
* Moved export parent query to its own function.
* Deferred export mesh creation until after all nodes are imported to prepare
  to implement support for skinning.
* Simplified export parent connection.  Two loops are no longer required.


=Version 0.5.3=
* Added name mangling option to preserve original names
* Added ability to import nodes with a user-selected sub-string in their names
  as joints.
* Added option to merge newly imported skins with existing skeletons
* Changed vertex color export code so that Maya 6.5 and Maya 7.0 are both
  supported.
* Niflib change fixes the problem with Oblivion skins not having the skin flag
  set properly, making the import of the skin weights fail.
* Added warnings if the user tries to export something with scale not 1.0 or
  with separate values for scale x, y, and z.
* Now import root nodes with non-identity transforms instead of treating them
  as the scene root and ignoring them.  Fixes some Morrowind skins.
  
=Version 0.5.5=
* Added Config options to:
  - Generate Oblivion tangent space.
  - Export triangles in strips
  - Set User Version
  - Generate skin partitions of specified size
* Config UI controls now have tool-tips.
* Fixed bug in skinning where shapes were bound as if the they had identity
  transforms, even if they didn't.
* Added bounding box import/export support.  This is non-Oblivion Collision.
* Changed default flags that are exported to be more standard.
* Invisibility is now correctly marked on imported transform node instead of the
  geometry node.
* You can now leave parts of the version number off at the end.  So 4 is equivalent
  to 4.0.0.0 and 10.2 is equivalent to 10.2.0.0, etc.
* Niflib improvements
  - Additional skinning bug fix - The better bodies meshes can now be imported and
    re-exported without problems.
  - Support for most files from the Freedom Force games
  - Corrected support for importing and exporting glow textures.
  
=Version 0.5.7=
* Bug Fixes:
  - The endian type was being set wrong, causing later version NIF files to be
    invalid.
  - Allowed files with invalid triangles to load.
  - Fixed bug where objects without textures could cause a file to fail to load.
* Combine With Existing Skeleton option now works even if the skeleton is in a
  different pose than the skeleton in the file being imported.
* New Texture Search Features
  - Ability to specify multiple texture search paths with new UI
  - Ability to use relative paths
  - The location of the NIF file is now searched.
  - Several games's default locations are now included in the default settings in
    addition to Morrowind's.
* Can now export texture paths:
 - Automatically as before, but now stripping parts that match any of the search
   paths in the list.
 - With no path, only the file name.
 - With the complete path.
 - With a user-specified prefix.
 
 =Version 0.5.8=

* Temporary Niflib data is now freed at the end of the functions that use it.
* Files with internal textures now generate a warning instead of failing to
  load entirely.
* Invalid triangles are now properly taken care of when setting vertex colors.
* Now apply all skin offsets (propagating interim transforms) as a
  post-process.  Allows Better Bodies files to be exported in such a way that
  they can be used in Morrowind without modification.
* Fixed a bug where a mesh with no vertices would cause export to fail.
* Fixed a bug in the way UV set numbers were assigned, which could cause
  export to fail.
* Fixed a bug where a missing joint was not being properly detected during
  export.
* Combine Skeleton and Search for Bind Position should not have been mutually
  exclusive.
* Fixed a bug where meshes had different numbers of textures on different
  parts that were combined with ComplexShape::Split causing a crash on export.
* Further bug fixes through changes in Niflib.
